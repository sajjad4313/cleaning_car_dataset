# cleaning_car_dataset

In this project, I created a dataset wherein we performed cleaning procedures by removing outliers and duplicates. Subsequently, we conducted an analysis of the outliers and effectively managed them. Now, the dataset is prepared for subsequent processing stages such as exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and visualization. It is important to note that we will continue working on this prepared dataset in the next phase of the project.
